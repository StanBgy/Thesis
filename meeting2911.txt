betas_split 

coming from all session in 
focus on the train/test set 

native_surface is all of it together - get mean? 
condition = labels 

mds: list of coordinates, -1 to 1, rotate around 0 
minize Sum of square of difference 

blobs of color 

mds take all and minize sum of square difference (rotation/flip) 
linearly solvable 
(x * sin(t) )squared +( y * cos(t) )squared  -> error term 

simplify it

easy to flip, x-x 
solve it twice for each pair? 

all pairs -> return error as well 

choose one rotation that is the easiest to work with 
so ex: two ends, error will be huge. Intermediate matrix will have lower error (V1 to V4). Find one where it is the smallest. So rotate everything for example V4 (if overall
error is smallest). 
Luis: area is sampling from itself. If we know the flip, we can flip Luis' model. Apply rotation to tuning models. Then look at prefered position (flatmaps). Bring ROI to same
space. 
So pull out how maps are co rotated. 

Second thing: Look at every area sampling from every other area (change mds space we're fitting in). Linearly fit gaussian function to data (predict beta of every voxel). 
Gaussian fit to amplitudes. 
Fit tuning function to all ROI to all ROI. -> explain reponse of V4 based on others 

Instead of saying which ROI is it: which ROI are we sampling from. x, y, best ROI and cross validated goodness of fit.
